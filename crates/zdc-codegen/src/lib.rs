#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! JavaScript and CSS emission, per spec §16.
//!
//! **Template cloning.** A view region compiles to one static HTML string,
//! parsed once into a `<template>`, cloned per instantiation, walked to
//! compile-time-computed `firstChild`/`nextSibling` offsets, with reactive
//! bindings attached only at the holes. Generated code never imports
//! `elements.js`: emitting calls into it would forfeit §14A.1's
//! monomorphic-shape claim by construction, because `props()` builds its
//! object by dynamic key insertion and `el`'s `Object.entries` then goes
//! megamorphic across the nine built-ins.
//!
//! **What this milestone covers.** `client` placement only — M5a in §16.5.
//! `hello.zd` and `counter.zd` need `zdc-hir` and `zdc-resolve` and nothing
//! else: with only client signals there is no placement to compute and no
//! boundary to cross. Everything that would need `zdc-graph` or `zdc-types`
//! emits a diagnostic naming what is missing, because a program that
//! compiles to something broken is worse than one that refuses.
